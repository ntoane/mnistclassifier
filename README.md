MNIST Handwritten digits classification using Artificial Neural Networks
- The project has three MNIST handwritten classification models, namely; MLP_Classifier.py, DNN_Classifier.py and CNN_Classifier.py.
- Each model is run independently and after the learning process it requires the user to enter the path to the MNIST_JPGS test image for classification.

Technologies used:
- Pytorch
- Torchvision
- Matplotlib
